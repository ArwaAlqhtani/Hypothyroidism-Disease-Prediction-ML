# Hypothyroidism-Disease-Prediction-ML

This project is part of the CPIS363 Course at King Abdulaziz University.
I chose this topic because the prevalence of thyroid disease in the Saudi population is 30%. Thyroid hormones are metabolically active in most of the organs, so any impairment in their function could affect quality of life. Hypothyroidism, also known as an underactive thyroid, causes fatigue, weight gain, and an inability to tolerate cold temperatures. It can be difficult to diagnose since the symptoms are often mistaken with those of other diseases. So I developed a machine learning model to detect whether a person has Hypothyroidism Disease or not.
This project goes through many steps. It starts with importing libraries , exploring the data and data pre-processing and ends with choosing the best machine learning techniques and model tuning.
